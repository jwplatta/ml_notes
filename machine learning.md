# Machine Learning

## Definition
Here are some attempts to define machine learning:

Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from [[data]]. 
- Aurelien Geron

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with resepct to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
- Tom Mitchell

TODO: add Charles Isbell's defintion from the lecture videos.

## Methods

Machine learning systems/algorithms can be broadly classified in the following ways:

- [[supervised learning]] or [[unsupervised learning]] or [[semisupervised learning]] or [[reinforcement learning]]
- [[online learning]] or [[batch learning]]
- [[instance-based learning]] or [[model-based learning]]

## Challenges
There are two primary ways a machin learning systems run into trouble: the algorithm is bad or the data is bad.

### Bad Algorithm

### Bad Data

[[feature engineering]]

[[performance measures]]
