# Supervised Learning

 In supervised learning, the training data includes labels, i.e. the desired solution. 
 
 Two typical supervised learning tasks are [[classification]] and [[regression]].
 
 Here are some common supervised learning algorithsm:
 - [[ensemble learning]]
 - [[k-nearest neighbors]]
 - linear regression
 - logistic regression
 - [[support vector machines]]
 - [[decision trees]] and [[random forests]]
 - [[neural networks]]
