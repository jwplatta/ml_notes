# Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the training data is _unlabeled_.

Here are some common unsupervised learning algorithms include: 
- [[clustering]] algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA).
- Anomaly/novelty detection such as one-class SVM and isolation forests
- Visualization and [[dimensionality reduction]] such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
- Association rule learning such as Apriori and Eclat.
